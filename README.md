# Envying Baby 💗

A warm, romantic theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — Valentine's Claude edition for hidden romantics in dependency hell.

![Envying Baby Theme Preview](screenshot.png)

## Philosophy

Most dark themes use cold, sterile grays that feel like working in a server room. Envying Baby is different. It uses **warm chocolates** with brown undertones that feel like a cozy cabin at night, and **luminous coral accents** that glow like a campfire in the darkness.

This theme is designed for those 14-hour debugging sessions when your eyes need kindness and your heart needs... well, maybe we don't talk about that.

## Features

**Light Mode — Sunlit Café**
- Warm cream backgrounds like aged paper
- Soft coral accents for links and highlights  
- Dark code blocks for strong contrast
- Perfect for daytime writing

**Dark Mode — Cozy Cabin at Night**
- Warm chocolate backgrounds (not cold grays!)
- Cream-tinted text (not harsh white!) for reduced eye strain
- Luminous coral accents with glow effects
- Code blocks that feel "sunken" into darkness
- Callouts that softly radiate light

**Both Modes Include**
- Consistent rounded corners for a soft, approachable feel
- Carefully tuned contrast ratios for accessibility
- Style Settings plugin support for customization
- Special CSS classes from the original design
